A 3x3 board of tiles numbered 1-9 is displayed to the player. The
player and bot can choose to replace one number during their turn 
with their symbol (X for player and O for bot). The player who
gets three of their symbols in a row, column or diagonally wins. If neither bot or player wins, it's a tie. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to use classes for. I don't get their purpose here. 

The UI is the console. 

Input for the user is received by being prompted to enter an integer from one to nine that still remains available on the board. The bot provides the same type of input but chooses their play randomly. 

Output is printed to the screen in the form of a word of results and messages.

Sample board:

1 2 3
4 5 6 
7 8 9

Classes needed:
Board, player, game.

Board class: 
  Stores the board.
  Prints the board to the screen.
  Provides "available" moves.

Game:
  Starts game.
  Prints game messages.
  Selects whose turn it is and asks for their input.

Actions left to figure-out:
  Checking results of board.
  Storing rounds (game).
  Receiving input from players.
  Validating input from players. 
  Set a game mode to play against yourself. 
  Replacing tiles when valid player input is provided. 

Further upgrades:
  Enable multiple-round playing. User must input if they'd like to continue playing the game. A class variable in Game tracks how many rounds were played.
